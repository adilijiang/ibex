Sample problems
---------------

This directory contains examples of input for ibex. It is recommended that these be copied to a separate directory before running to keep the source directory clean. All problems use the "ibex" executable in the install directory, and can be run as

::

   ibex (xml input file)

Some of the python scripts assume that PYTHONPATH has been set as instructed in the "install.rst" file in the base source directory. Otherwise, the mesh_functions.py file from ibex/scripts may need to be copied to the test directory.
